<br> <Br> Built in 1856 during the Spanish colonial era,<strong> Bigo Bridge </strong> â€”locally known as Puente de Ibabang Bukalâ€”is a stone arch bridge made from perfectly cut adobe stones, lime, and even honey. Once part of a crucial trade route connecting Pagbilao and Tayabas, it was constructed through polo y servicio (forced labor), and remains standing after more than 165 years.

Surrounded by dense greenery and folklore, the bridge is rich in mystery. Locals speak of santelmo (fire spirits), shadow figures, and a glowing white cross that fades upon approach. Its moss-covered railings and Roman numeral-marked stones whisper tales of devotion and hardshipâ€”where villagers once had to bring stones to church or face 25 lashes.</p>

<br> <br>Tucked quietly along the Tayabas-Pagbilao road, <strong> Calibuyboy Bridge </strong> may span just a little over five meters, but its historical weight stretches across centuries. Constructed in the 1870s during the Spanish colonial period, this modest stone bridge was built through polo y servicioâ€”a system of forced labor imposed on Filipino men. Made from adobe blocks and lime powder, it was once a vital link in the Calle Real, the grand Spanish highway connecting coastal towns for governance, trade, and communication. Now partly overgrown by trees and tangled roots, the bridge still serves its purposeâ€”silently ferrying local traders, residents, and occasional wanderers. From coconut-laden carts to whispering winds, Calibuyboy remains a conduit of both movement and memory.
Yet, this heritage site is not without mystery. Locals speak of unsettling sightingsâ€”from a pig-faced boy to a cigar-smoking tikbalang, and a white lady said to drift silently across the bridge by moonlight. These stories have earned Calibuyboy a place in the town's rich folklore.
Despite its deteriorating structure, narrow one-lane width, and nearby unfinished roadwork, Calibuyboy Bridge remains an important passageâ€”both literal and symbolic</p>

                    <h4><strong>More about Iyakin Bridge </strong> </h4>
<br> <br> <strong> Iyakin Bridge </strong> , located in Sitio Pag-asa, Barangay Bukal, Pagbilao, Quezon, is a small yet historically rich Spanish-era structure built in the 1870s through polo y servicio (forced labor). It was part of the old Calle Real, the Spanish colonial road network that connected Tayabas, Pagbilao, and other nearby towns for trade and governance. Constructed from adobe stones, molasses, and lime powder, it remains in use today, quietly supporting light vehicles and local foot traffic over a shallow creek linked to the Iyakin River.

Measuring roughly 14 feet long and 19 feet wide, the bridge sits at an elevation of 3.44 meters, surrounded by bamboo, mango trees, and thick vegetation. It blends naturally into the landscape, making it nearly unnoticeable to passersby. Though still in fair condition, its lack of lights, damaged signs, and overgrown surroundings have made it an accident-prone areaâ€”fueling both public safety concerns and ghost stories.

Local legends surround the bridge: tales of a white lady, a giant smoking tikbalang, and eerie cries from the river are passed down among residents. Mrs. Leonides Ramos, a long-time local, shared how the bridge was used during Japanese occupation, with guerrillas hiding in the trees nearby. As a child, she crossed the bridge to trade goods like tapioca and fishâ€”highlighting its role in community commerce. Today, it continues to serve traders and transporters from towns like Tayabas, Pagbilao, Sariaya, and even as far as Bicol and Manila.

Some historians, including Mr. John Valdeavilla, refer to it as "Puente de Juan", linking it to Juan Alvarez Guerra, the Spanish writer who possibly passed this bridge during his journey in the 1800s, later documented in his book Viajes por Filipinas.

<br> <br> <strong> Tulay ng Salak </strong> , located in Sitio Pulang Lupa, Barangay Silangang Malicboy, is a small yet historically important concrete beam bridge built during the American colonial period. Measuring just 8.94 meters long and 2.29 meters wide, it once served as a key part of the old Provincial Road of Quezon, linking Northern Quezon to the Bicol Region. The bridge played a vital role in transporting goods and providing access for farmers and students, especially during heavy rains. Though now worn and with damaged, low barriers, it remains a symbol of the area's past connectivity. Its deck was later elevated with gravel to align with nearby roads, and despite its modest size, Tulay ng Salak continues to be remembered as a lifeline for communities on both sides.

Measuring 103 meters long and 22 meters wide, this concrete dock once began as a simple floating balsa in the 1950s. Today, it bustles with fishermen, vendors, and locals lounging by its baywalk under ornamental palms. From daily fish hauls to fluvial parades for Sta. Catalina, the port has long connected Pagbilao to its islands and identity.
<br> <br> ðŸŒŸ Fun Fact: It used to rise and fall with the tideâ€”and now hosts everything from sea blessings to spooky sightings and birthday celebrations!

<br> <br> Located just in front of the Barangay Hall of Daungan, the Pantalan ng Pagbilao spans 103 meters long and 22 meters wide, made of concrete with tiled floors, wooden stalls, and green-roofed shelters. Once a floating balsa raft built in the 1950s under the leadership of Counselor Emilio Gloria, the port served as a lifeline for traders and bangkeros traveling between the mainland and coastal barangays like Ilayang Polo and Ibabang Polo. Over time, land was filled in, and through efforts by leaders like Congressman Manuel Enverga and Mayor Romar Portes, the port was fully concretized and beautified with benches, lights, palm trees, and CCTV. Today, it remains a vital hub for fishing, trading, and community life, rich in both history and local spirit.

Beyond its utility, it's a silent witness to a heroic moment in WWIIâ€”when American troops blew up its wooden predecessor to delay advancing Japanese forces and protect Filipino soldiers.
<br> <br> ðŸŒŸ Fun Fact: On Christmas Day, 1941, under enemy fire, U.S. forces dynamited the bridge as Colonel Cordero's last troops made their retreat. The blast lit up the night sky, a memory still vivid to then-young Tiburcio Rubico. In later years, the rebuilt bridge became a space for childhood funâ€”kids sliding on wooden planks, spying on bathers, or hauling bananas to the market. A battleground turned into a playground of memories!

<br> <br> <strong> Palsabangon Bridge </strong> , located in Brgy. Ibabang Palsabangon, is a 60-meter-long girder-type concrete and steel bridge that forms part of the national highway connecting Quezon Province to the Bicol Region. First appearing about three kilometers after the Tambak Bridge, it was originally built using timber wood (traviesa) during the World War II era and later reinforced in 1998 as a permanent concrete structure. With sidewalks, white-painted parapets, and built-in drainage holes, the bridge remains a vital artery for transporting goods and commuters. While the view may be modestâ€”except for a glimpse of the old railroad bridge downstreamâ€”its role in linking communities, economies, and wartime history makes it a crucial piece of infrastructure in the region.

<br> <br> <strong>Portes Brother's Cockpit Arena </strong> , located along the Tayabasâ€“Pagbilao Road, is a cultural structure once known for hosting local cockfights. Enclosed by a bamboo fence and topped with a red galvanized roof, it features steel trusses, wooden bleachers, and a 6Ã—6 meter roweda (fighting stage). Inside, aged tarpaulins, dusty interiors, and a grilled red ulutan area reflect years of vibrant activity and recent silence.
Originally intended as a beer house, the arena was built in 1972 by Joaquinito and Romeo "Romar" Portes but pivoted to cockfighting due to Martial Law. From its humble bamboo-and-anahaw start, it saw renovations in 1976, additions in the '80s and '90s, and storm damage repairs in 2014. It closed in 2020 due to the pandemic and remains inactive.

<br> <br>The <strong> Home Economics (HE) Hall </strong> of Pagbilao Central Elementary School, built around 1922, is located just behind the Supervisor's Office and across from the Grade 6 classrooms. It features traditional capiz shell windows with wooden frames, ten doors including comfort rooms and storage areas, and a mix of wooden and concrete flooring. The structure, though aged, has been well-preserved through regular repainting and repairs, staying true to its original design. Originally used for Home Economics classes and hands-on learning activities, it became a space where generations of students practiced skills in cooking, sewing, and household management. Over time, added security features like window grills were donated by stakeholders. Although now used mostly for storage, the HE Hall remains a nostalgic part of the campusâ€”both for its educational purpose and for the ghost stories that linger in student memory.

<br> <br>The Prefabricated Marcos Type Building at Pagbilao East Elementary School stands behind the mini park, distinguished by hand-painted murals of nature, maps, animals, and school life that reflect a lively learning atmosphere. Surrounded by trees like narra and mango, the five-classroom building features sky blue and yellow-green walls, steel windows and doors, red roofing, and a vibrant garden with flower boxes and outdoor seating. Built around the 1970s during the Marcos administration, it was part of a nationwide initiative to address classroom shortages. Designed for practicality, the structure originally included foldable wooden partitions to convert rooms into a larger space. Over the years, the building has been renovated with new concrete walls, fresh paint, and roof repairs following typhoon damage. Now home to Grade 4 classrooms, it remains a lasting symbol of the educational reforms of its time.

Scientifically, it has also been usedâ€”when permittedâ€”for the study of cadavers in aid of research and forensic investigation."

<br> <br><strong> Pagbilao Old Cemetery </strong>, covering around three hectares, lies between Sitio Pulong Niyugan in Brgy. Castillo and Brgy. Mapagong, with its main entrance along the Pan-Philippine Highway near the old Digitel building. With no formal signage or gate, the landmark is the yellowish sepulcher of the Pornella-Luce family. The cemetery is marked by overgrown grass, Indian almond trees, and a mix of grave stylesâ€”ranging from grand angel statues to simple rectangular tombs. A unique three-layered apartment-style tomb stands out among the weathered graves. Notably, it is the final resting place of prominent figures like Mayors Rosauro Radovan, Cesar Merto, Trinidad Alvarez, and land donor Segundo Martinez.
Originally a swamp, the land was donated in 1912 by Mayor Martinez for public use. Though the site was eventually closed after the construction of a new cemetery in 1891, it continued to be used for burials. November remains the busiest time as families clean and visit tombs, while abandoned graves are moved to a mass grave. Managed by appointed leaders from the parish of St. Catherine of Alexandria, the cemetery has been under the care of several community heads, with Engr. Dante Lagrama currently overseeing its maintenance.

<br> <br><strong> Bukal ng Itang </strong>, a humble spring-fed well located amidst the rice fields and muddy terrain of Barangay Antipolo, Pagbilao, stands as a vital part of the community's daily life and heritage. With a mouth measuring about 0.61 meters in diameter and a depth of 2.13 meters, its waters shimmer in a clear bluish-green hue reminiscent of ocean glass, drawing attention not just for utility but also for its natural charm. Surrounded by grassy patches and trees, it sits quietly in the rural landscape, not far from a rice field. Historically, the well is believed to date back to the Spanish era and is named after a local man called "Itang," who is said to have dug it. The Sangguniang Barangay of Antipolo constructed a concrete culvert around it in 1998 to improve its access and durability. Over the years, Bukal ng Itang has served as the primary water source for many households, especially during times before piped water systems became available. Locals used it for drinking, bathing, and laundry. According to Brgy. Councilor Fernando Bongcahis, it was once surrounded by a forest-like environment and was believed to be guarded by a mythical "nuno," a spirit in Filipino folklore said to curse those who disrespect its space. Many residents recall experiencing illnesses they believed were due to disturbing this spirit. Children, including Bongcahis himself, fondly remember bathing in the spring before school, leaving their water containers behind to collect later in the day. Though modern amenities have changed how water is sourced, the well continues to serve those in need and is maintained as a symbol of local resilience, folklore, and environmental harmony.

<br> <br>Located in Barangay Sta. Catalina, Pagbilao, this heritage wellâ€”constructed in 1870 during the Spanish colonial periodâ€”is made of riffraff adobe stones and concrete, with a depth of 20 feet and a circumference of 540 cm. Originally built by Chinese settler Go Inco Ma for his family's water needs such as drinking, washing, and laundry, the well has been preserved across generations, with the current caretaker being the fourth-generation descendant from the Goyma family line. Fed by an underground spring, the water remains remarkably clear, often likened to glassy ocean water. An arch covers the well for user safety, and its surroundings feature native plants like tawa-tawa (a folk remedy for dengue), gabi, and fruit-bearing trees including citrus, banana, and papaya. Occupying an 800-square-meter lot beside Cajes Ice Cream and across Agora Pagbilao, the well remains a historical and communal feature within the vibrant market area.

<br> <br><strong> The EME Road </strong>, or Old Zigzag Road, is a 7-kilometer stretch nestled within the Quezon Protected Landscape in Barangay Silangang Malicboy, Pagbilao, Quezon. Measuring 15 meters wide and constructed with a mix of asphalt and cement, this winding mountain pass connects Northern and Southern Luzon through the Pan-Philippine Highway. Famous for its three sharp curves known as "siko," the road features colorful safety barriers and concrete signage honoring President Ferdinand Marcos and Anacleto P. Alcala. A scenic viewpoint near the second curve, complete with concrete stairs, provides a popular photo spot for travelers. Despite its narrow and often slippery path, especially during rains, the road remains well-patrolled by volunteer aides and offers a lush, forested environment with cool mountain air. Known locally as Bitukang Manok for its intestine-like shape, it presents both a challenging and scenic journey for drivers.
Historically, the EME Road was discovered by Alfredo Castro around 1904â€“1905 and constructed in 1929 under the direction of American engineer Julius Vogelgesang during President Manuel L. Quezon's administration. It was completed in 1935 after six years and later improved in 1969 during the Marcos era. Initially perilous due to unprotected cliffs, the road has since been reinforced with safety features. It played a significant role during World War II, serving as a supply route for Japanese forces following their landing at Lamon Bay in Atimonan. In recent years, natural disasters such as Typhoon Mario in 2014 and heavy rains in 2018 caused damage and prompted restoration efforts. Today, the EME Road is not only an essential transportation route but also a tourist attraction and cultural icon, beloved for its natural beauty and steeped in both history and myth.

                    <h4><strong>More about <br> PNR Station <br> (Silangang  Malicboy)  </strong> </h4>
<br> <br>Located in Barangay Silangang Malicboy, Pagbilao, the <strong> old Philippine National Railway Station </strong> is one of the earliest in Quezon, with an estimated floor area of 80 square meters. The foundation is made of concrete, while the upper structure was originally built with hardwood, including wooden windows and a now-deteriorated roof. Red and green paint remains faintly visible near the ground. The station is surrounded by trees, nearby homes, and the railway line on its right side, still marked by scattered support rocks.
Opened in 1914, the Malicboy Station was part of the Manilaâ€“Legazpi line, approximately 156 km from Tutuban. It once served passenger and cargo trains such as the Lucena Express, Penafrancia Express, and Mayon Limited (1988), all now defunct. With the rise of road transport, railway operations declined, and no repairs or restorations have since been made to the station, leaving it in its current state of quiet decay.

Located just 40 meters from the public market in Brgy. Del Carmen, the station was built with narra wood, featuring a Dutch-style door and tool room. Over the years, it became more than just a train stopâ€”locals used it for birthdays, weddings, and even as a playground. Today, only about 10% of the structure remains, partly occupied by families and small businesses.

<br> <br>The <strong> Pagbilao Railroad Station </strong>, located just 40 meters from the town's public market, was once a vital hub of transport and trade in Quezon Province. Constructed in 1914 during the Manila Railroad Company era (later renamed Philippine National Railways in 1960), the station featured narra wood trusses and walls, a Dutch-style double door, a tool storage room, and screened metal windows. Surrounded by banana trees and remnants of construction materials, it stood as a modest yet functional structure. For 92 years, it served routes connecting Manila to Lucena, Pagbilao to Naga, and onward to Legazpi, providing local residents with access to transportation, commerce, and opportunity. However, its operations ceased in 2006 after Typhoon Milenyo severely damaged the station and destroyed the nearby Mamala Bridge, cutting off access and halting rail service. Though now abandoned, the station remains a nostalgic landmark in Pagbilao's history.

<br> <br>The <strong> Gudani ancestral house </strong> in Brgy. Sta. Catalina, Pagbilao, sits on a 300-square-meter lot near the public market and tricycle terminal. Painted chocolate brown with capiz shell windows, narra wood carvings, and classic furniture, it reflects old Filipino-Spanish architecture. The two-storey home has three rooms, a wooden staircase, chandeliers, antique religious items, and even bullet holes from the Japanese era. Originally built in 1908 by Ruperto Gudani, a fisherman who survived a pirate attack and credited his recovery and success to the Blessed Virgin Mary, the house was relocated to its current site in 1909 after being displaced by the expansion of the Manila Railroad. It stands today as a symbol of faith, resilience, and family heritage passed through generations.
