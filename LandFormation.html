                    <h4><strong>More about Patayan Island </strong> </h4>

<br> <Br> <strong> Patayan Island </strong>, a 26.98-hectare landmass off the coast of Brgy. Pinagbayanan in Pagbilao, Quezon, is a unique island known for its inverted-liver shape when viewed from the map. Surrounded by the barangays of Pinagbayanan, Bantigue, Mapagong, and Palsabangon, the island lies 20 to 30 minutes away by boat from Daungan Port, depending on sea conditions and boat speed. It is famed for its "tulay buhangin" or vanishing sandbar, which appears only at dawn and fades as the tide rises. The shoreline is mostly covered with white pebbles and pyrite nodules, giving it a white-sand effect from afar. Rich in biodiversity, Patayan Island is surrounded by mangrove vegetation such as bakawan, pipisik, aroma, and pagatpat, which serve as habitat for fish like talakitok, baliwis, and kanuping, as well as birds, snakes, and monitor lizards. The island also offers stunning views of the sunrise, sunset, and the Team Energy power plant across the water.
Historically, the island is shrouded in mystery and folklore. Its name, "Patayan," is believed to have originated from stories passed down through generations, suggesting that the island was once a site of pirate executions. Locals like Mr. Pedro Macarulay and Brgy. Captain Rennan Salles support this theory, though no physical evidence remains. Ownership of the island has changed hands over the years, beginning with Mr. Borlongan, followed by the Sio family, who lived on the island during World War II, and later by the Santayana family. Although there was an attempt to rename it "Calilayan Island," the original name was eventually restored. Today, only three families reside on the island, serving as caretakers of both the fishpond owned by politician Proceso Alcala and the private properties scattered throughout the area.
While Patayan Island is a favorite summer destination for tourists who come to enjoy its serene landscape and picturesque views, it also faces environmental and jurisdictional threats, including erosion, unregulated tourism, and climate change. Despite these challenges, the island remains a symbol of Pagbilao's natural beauty, cultural depth, and enduring folklore.</p>

<br> <Br> <strong> Balugbog Baboy Sandbar </strong>, located between Brgy. Bantigue and Brgy.

                    <h4><strong>More about <br> Bilaran Sandbar </strong> </h4>

<br> <Br> <strong> Bilaran Sandbar </strong>, located 9 kilometers off the coast of Pagbilao, Quezon, is a crescent-shaped stretch of white sand known for its scenic backdrop of Mount Banahaw, Pagbilao Bay, and the Team Energy power plant. The sandbar measures around 546 meters at its tip and about 152 meters at its widest point, though its size varies with the tide. The clear waters surrounding it are home to a diverse marine ecosystem, including sea urchins, starfish, jellyfish, clams, snails, and crabs. Local lore attributes the sandbar's crescent shape to the strong currents from Tayabas Bay pushing sand inward. Historically, Bilaran was used by fishermen to dry their catch and take shelter during storms. According to SAMBACA President Isidro Sartin, the sandbar once stood about 15 feet highâ€”its peak even had a nipa hut for resting. Over the years, quarrying flattened its elevation, and stories of mysterious lights known as "Santelmo" add an eerie charm to the place. In 2001, a ship bound for Masbate caught fire nearby, and Team Energy employees helped rescue passengers. Between 2017 and 2018, a floating cottage built by SAMBACA members brought renewed interest to the sandbar, even catching the attention of GMA's "Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho." The site's fame grew as celebrities like Coco Martin, Yeng Constantino, and Zsa Zsa Padilla visited, with Padilla featuring it in her vlog. During extreme low tides, Bilaran appears to connect with two nearby sandbars, forming a formation locals call "Balugbog Baboy" due to its resemblance to a pig's spine. Registered groups like SAMBACA now offer island-hopping tours that include Bilaran, Kwebang Lampas, and Isla Salamin, which support the community through tourism income and mussel harvesting. Despite facing threats such as over-tourism, sand mining, and misinformation, Bilaran Sandbar remains a treasured ecological and cultural landmark in Pagbilao.</p>

<br> <Br> <strong>Daungan Pari  </strong>, located in Sitio Daungan Pari, Brgy. Binahaan, Pagbilao, Quezon, lies about 9.4 kilometers off the main highway and connects directly to the Binahaan River and Pagbilao's seawaters. The area is characterized by its muddy shoreline, common among mangrove zones and estuaries, and is home to a range of marine life and waterbirds. Upon arrival, one notices the presence of informal settlers, colorful fishing boats, and a mix of natural greenery. A concrete chapel now stands near the water's edge, accompanied by an 8-foot cross, marking its religious importance.
According to local history and a plaque mounted on the chapel wall, this spot is where Franciscan missionaries first arrived in 1688, making it the birthplace of Christianity in Pagbilao. The original chapel, made of bamboo and cogon, stood here before the population moved inland to establish the current town center. The present-day concrete chapel was built between 2017 and 2019 with the help of the 609 Gun Club, Father Joseph Estrema, and local leaders.
Folklore adds mystique to the site. Local accounts speak of hidden treasuresâ€”gold bars and a bell said to be buried along with a Franciscan priest. A rock engraved with "CARDO" and "RIP" supposedly marked the burial site, but it was later stolen. Residents also recount eerie sightings: a headless priest and a vanishing black pig, contributing to the site's rich tapestry of history, faith, and legend.</p>

<br> <Br> <strong>Balete Beach </strong>, tucked in a remote corner of Pagbilao Grande Island behind the Pagbilao Power Station, is one of the town's most underrated yet naturally captivating destinations. It features a quiet stretch of powdery white sand, crystal-clear waters, and views of Patayan Island and the sunset. Accessible by a 20-minute boat ride from Pantalan ng Pagbilao or a 1-kilometer walk from Jenny's Beach, the path to Balete Beach is lined with balete and aroma trees. The beach is known for its colorful pebbles, coral rocks, and lush coastal greenery, including ancient mango and yucca plants. Its rocky areas require caution, making aqua shoes advisable. A few remnants of its pastâ€”such as a comfort room and stairsâ€”reveal its history as a resort managed by the Garcia clan in the 1980s.
According to longtime resident Virgilio Calizo Sr., Balete Beach was once owned by the Glodoviza-Glorioso clan and later sold to the Garcias, who transformed it into a private resort with bamboo and cogon cottages. It was even used for drying coconuts and as a quarry site, where locals believed Spanish treasures were hidden. Calizo recalled finding gold coins along streams after bad weather, which locals once used for bartering. Balete Beach has its share of legendsâ€”stories of a giant face in the cottage window, a crying girl, and a glowing fireball known as santelmo believed to mark hidden treasure sites. Film buffs may also recognize it as the shooting location of the 1975 film Madugong Daigdig ni Salvacion, starring Ricky Belmonte and Cristina Ponce. Locals like Martin Calizo and the Pornela family also reported eerie sightings of half-bodied creatures and mysterious beings by the trees, which some still believe protect the beach and its secrets.</p>

<br> <Br> <strong> La Isla Salamin </strong>, located in Sitio PiÃ±a, Brgy. Ilayang Polo, Pagbilao, Quezon, lies southwest of the Tattacan and Davauan Rivers and is accessible by a 45-minute boat ride from Pagbilao Pantalan. It features five beachfront cottages, heart-shaped mangrove clusters, and a riprapped shoreline framed by two mountains facing each otherâ€”said to resemble a mirror, which inspired its name. The island offers muddy white sand, rich biodiversity including birds, butterflies, and wild animals, and coastal flora like mangroves, coconut trees, and yucca. It is also home to two cavesâ€”one accessible with stairsâ€”surrounded by oysters, clams, and aroma trees.

According to local lore, La Isla Salamin was once believed to be inhabited by fairies that admired their reflections in the crystal-clear sea. Folktales describe the island as mystical, guarded by engkantos (supernatural beings), with some claiming sightings of black shadows and magical events. Stories include the sighting of a monkey-like figure in place of a person, eerie sounds of a growling golden bull that allegedly escaped into a hole, and the discovery of a mysterious "gusi" (old pot) and weapon container from the Japanese era. The island, once owned by the Escudero family and now by PC SUPT. Erickson Velasquez, has become a venue for police gatherings, pictorials, and island toursâ€”yet remains shrouded in tales of hidden treasure and enchantment.

                    <h4><strong>More about <br> Lima-aw Mountain </strong> </h4>

<br> <Br> <strong>Lima-aw Mountain </strong> is located at the heart of Pagbilao Grande Island and is characterized by its closely grouped peaks and ridges resembling a cluster of similarly built homes. With steep slopes and sharp or rounded edges, most of its summits are pointed, except for one distinctively flat peak at the center, which offers a natural vantage point. Visible even from the main road, some of its caves and rock formations hint at the mountain's raw, rugged beauty. At the mountain's base, signs of erosion and fallen rocks suggest natural wear over time.
Stories tied to Lima-aw Mountain reveal its mystical and historical depth. Jose Estrope, a longtime resident and caretaker at the foot of the mountain, claims to have met a spirit named "Carding" who gifted him a magical five-peso coin that returned to his pocket after each use. Bound by a vow of secrecy, Jose fell ill when he revealed the coin's secret and was later healed by a faith healer who tattooed a protective charm on his chest. His wife, Asuncion, shared how their family eventually moved away from the mountain for safety. Their granddaughter, Christine, now tends to their buffaloes near Lima-aw and observes native wildlife like monkeys and hawks. Meanwhile, Jonathan Edrad recounted his grandfather's wartime memory of seeing a Japanese autogyro land on Lima-aw's flat peak, adding a historical layer to the mountain's enigmatic reputation.

                    <p class="mobile-description"> Tucked beneath balete and bay-it trees on <strong> La Isla Salamin </strong> in Brgy. Polo, Pagbilao, Quezon, lies a mysterious cave with three distinct chambersâ€”each with its own tale. Just 15 meters from the beach, it's reached by an eight-step staircase built by its caretaker. Inside, tree roots twist along the walls, sunlight pours through ceiling holes, and whispers of diwatas and Spanish-era tombs linger. Home to bats and the island's blue "chakrit" birds, the cave thrives in cool, damp silence. While the island's white sand draws visitors, many say the true adventure lies undergroundâ€”where nature and folklore collide.
<br> <br> ðŸŒŸFun Fact: Locals say Isla Salamin got its name from a diwata who used the sea as her mirror and made the cave her homeâ€”making it one of Pagbilao's most magical hidden gems.

<br> <Br>  Tucked within a three-hectare land in <strong> La Isla Salamin </strong>, Brgy. Polo, Pagbilao, Quezon, lies a hidden, castle-like cave surrounded by balete, bay-it, and aroma trees. Just 15 meters from the beach, the cave is accessible via an eight-step staircase built by its current owner. The cave's entrance, around three meters wide, leads to three distinct chambers. The first room, partially covered by bay-it tree trunks, is elevated and slippery due to rainwater and is supported by balete roots. The second chamber resembles an altar with natural skylights, fallen stalactites, and a wide floor. The third is a long tunnel filled with bats and insects, leading to a small, dim room known to house "chakrit" birds. Local stories enhance its mysteryâ€”Mr. Tisoy shared that visitors often prefer cave exploration over the beach, and one couple even camped inside for their anniversary. Tombstones at the cave's entrance, said to mark Spaniards' graves, add historical intrigue. Meanwhile, folktales from Mr. Isidro Sartin tell of a diwata who once used the sea as a mirror, inspiring the name Isla Salamin.

<br> <Br> <strong> Mangilalan Cave </strong>, nestled deep in the forests of Brgy. Ilayang Bagumbungan, is one of the most recognized caves in Quezon. Covered in moss and local plants like "lukmoy" (Epipremnum pinnatum), the cave features a narrow entrance and a cool interior with a natural waterfall. Inside, a unique "Lamesang Bato" or stone table with a chalice-like dip is treated like a holy font. In 1983, local resident Apolinario Diala discovered a Japanese soldier's helmet inside, believed to be from wartime, though it mysteriously vanished soon after. Locals also tell of a Japanese man who once lived by the cave with a Filipina wife. Despite the darkness and bats, Father Obena of St. Catherine Parish once held a full Catholic mass inside, adding to the cave's rich spiritual and historical legacy.

Socioeconomically, the cave once played a vital role in the livelihood of Ilayang Polo residents during the guano period, when bat manure was harvested and sold as natural fertilizer. Historically, it is believed to have served as a hideout for Japanese soldiers during World War II due to its concealed and spacious structure. Scientifically, the cave attracted researchers who collected stalactite and stalagmite samples for study and potential commercial use. Spiritually, locals believe the cave once functioned as a worship site, possibly during the Japanese era, given its large capacity and natural lightingâ€”setting it apart from darker, more enclosed caves in the area."

Once used for keeping goats, collecting bat guano, and holding spiritual rituals, it's also surrounded by local folkloreâ€”some say buried kitchenware lies within, and others believe it served as a secret church. Many locals think it connects underground to the nearby Lima-aw Cave.
<br> <br> ðŸŒŸFun Fact: Because of its two open ends and short length, wind rushes straight through Sibatiya Caveâ€”making it feel like nature's very own air-conditioned chapel!

<br> <Br> <strong> Sibatiya Cave </strong>, found just 20 minutes from the barangay hall of Ilayang Polo and nestled near the mountains of Lima-aw, is known for its two massive entryways that let air and sunlight pass freelyâ€”earning it the nickname "Kwebang Mahangin" or Windy Cave. Owned by the Marciano family, the cave features towering ceilings reaching 20 meters, yellow-white stalactites, mossy stone walls, and a floor often covered with goat and bat manure, as it once sheltered livestock and guano gatherers. Surrounding it are balete, bay-it, mango, and banana trees, with thick roots supporting its natural archways. Locals like Miguel Palmero recall buried kitchenware once found inside, believed to have been left by unknown settlers. Faith healer Eugenio Sinaggote shared that he and his father used to offer Good Friday rituals inside the cave to honor unseen spirits, which he believes granted him healing powers. Stories also tell of Sibatiya once serving as a church due to its spacious interior and its possible underground connection to nearby Lima-aw Cave.
