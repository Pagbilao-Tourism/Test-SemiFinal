                    <h4><strong>More about <br> Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Seminary <br> Institute of Formation</strong> </h4>

<br> <Br> The <strong> Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Seminary </strong> in Pagbilao, Quezon is a unique religious institution dedicated to the early formation of future Catholic priests. It traces its beginnings to the Diocesan Pastoral Formation Center temporarily located in Isabang, Lucena City, where Fr. Romeo Padillo served as the first rector in 1997. With the support of Most Rev. Ruben T. Profugo, the seminary found its permanent home on June 16, 2005, in the area previously known as ‚Äúboys‚Äô town‚Äù or St. Dominic Savio, which was once a rehabilitation center for juvenile offenders. The seminary's foundation on this site marked a significant transformation‚Äîfrom a place of correction to one of spiritual formation and hope.
Under the leadership of Most Rev. Emilio Z. Marquez and the guidance of then-director Fr. Jose Ilagan Cantos II and spiritual director Msgr. Armando Perez, the seminary began offering a one-year pre-college formation. The program focuses on four key aspects: academic, social, spiritual, and pastoral development. Seminarians study a range of subjects including Basic Bible, Philosophy, Theology, English, Spanish, Laudato Si, Logic, and Mathematics. After completing their year in Pagbilao, students proceed to Lucban for a four-year college course and another five years of theology, culminating in ordination.
The seminary‚Äôs chapel, dedicated to St. Joseph, was generously donated by Engr. Manuel and Mrs. Sonia Sangalang and was blessed on December 15, 2007. The facility also includes a donated covered basketball court by Dr. Helen Tan, which has served as a venue for public health services like flu vaccination drives. While primarily serving seminarians, the chapel occasionally hosts weddings and baptisms, especially when nearby parishes like St. Catherine of Alexandria Church are unavailable, although such events are kept minimal to maintain the sacred formation environment.
A notable initiative began in 2015‚Äì2016 when a new team of formators‚ÄîRev. Fr. Everett Calvendra, Rev. Fr. Marcelo Cabarrubias, and Rev. Fr. Eaul Macaraig‚Äîestablished the ‚ÄúIFRIENDS‚Äù (Institute of Formation Religious Endowment for Seminary Development) to support the seminary financially through benefactors. In 2019, the seminary‚Äôs retablo (altar backdrop) was renovated in time for the Feast of St. Joseph on March 19. Public devotion is also encouraged through monthly novenas and Masses every 19th of the month.
The seminary is currently home to 14 seminarians and is under the care of four household members: two priests and two seminarians, including current director Rev. Fr. Misael Hernandez. The seminary caters not only to vocations from the Diocese of Lucena but also from the Diocese of Boac and the Prelature of Infanta. Strict discipline is maintained, such as limiting phone access to one emergency call per seminarian, all supervised by Fr. Hernandez and Fr. Jerson Rey.
Over the years, the seminary has produced 23 priests, two of whom are from Pagbilao. It has also welcomed international students, such as Fr. Joseph Deng from China (now serving in Yujiang, China) and Fr. Ariel Bautista from the U.S. (now serving in New Jersey). Catholic schools in nearby towns also book recollection activities at the seminary, allowing students to deepen their spiritual lives and learn about priestly vocation.</p>

<br> <Br><strong> Pagbilao East Elementary School (PEES) </strong> was founded in 1975 to serve students from Barangay Poblacion and nearby areas when the growing population of learners outnumbered the available teachers. Originally part of Pagbilao Elementary School, it was known as ‚ÄúSa Dakong Silangan‚Äù and officially became a separate institution through the leadership of Ms. Rosa B. Castro. The school steadily expanded through land donations and strong community support, producing students who have won awards in various academic, musical, and athletic competitions. PEES has also functioned as a vaccination site and venue for community sports due to its spacious grounds. Over the years, it has been led by a series of dedicated principals and officers-in-charge, with Mr. Rommel Roperez currently serving as Principal II. The school remains a source of pride, continuously producing graduates‚Äîsome of whom return as teachers to serve their alma mater.

The area is not only a natural haven but also a center for education and community development. With strict guidelines in place, tourists must be accompanied by trained guides, and efforts are ongoing to improve eco-tourism facilities like the picnic areas and natural pools. Historically, the region played a role during the Japanese era, and local lore even speaks of hidden treasures within the forest.

According to current president Mrs. Apolonia Merjudio, a retired teacher, leadership within the group has always been informal due to its small size, and there is no formal organizational chart or documentation. Today, only six elderly members remain, faithfully singing at the 6:00 AM mass when possible. One of the group‚Äôs proudest moments was winning a local choral competition during the Araw ng Pagbilao celebration, where they debuted the now-beloved hymn ‚ÄúPapag at Bilao,‚Äù written by Pepe Merto. According to member Feliza ‚ÄúLily‚Äù De Rama, the group once performed widely across the town and won several awards in their prime. Rehearsals were often held at the Merto family home, which became an informal practice space. After Rosario Merto‚Äôs passing, the group returned to rehearsing and gathering at the church. Despite a decline in members and activity‚Äîespecially during the pandemic‚Äîthe group remains a quiet but enduring symbol of Pagbilao‚Äôs musical devotion.</p>

<br> <Br><strong>Teatro Tanghalang Pagbilao </strong>, also known as Teatro Tanglao, was founded in 1997 as a parish youth initiative under the guidance of Rev. Fr. Edilberto ‚ÄúEjay‚Äù Jarapa and Rev. Msgr. Antonio L. Obe√±a. The group was formed after representatives of the Saint Catherine of Alexandria Parish joined a theater workshop organized by the Diocese of Lucena.

Their plays‚Äîlike Ambon ng Kristal, Salawahang Buwan, and the annual Senakulo‚Äîhave become cultural milestones in Pagbilao and inspired similar efforts in neighboring towns.

                    <h4><strong>More about <br> Talipan National High School </strong> </h4>
<br> <Br><strong>Talipan National High School </strong>, formerly known as Talipan Barangay High School, was founded in 1973 through the united efforts of the local community and visionary leaders in response to the growing educational needs of Barangay Talipan and its nearby areas. Located about four kilometers from Pagbilao town proper and five kilometers from Lucena City, the school is the largest public secondary institution in the district, currently catering to over 2,000 students and producing around 400 graduates each year. The school‚Äôs establishment was driven by the initiative of then Barangay Captain Rafael P. Glorioso, who, together with parents and students, petitioned for a local high school. Their request was granted through the implementation of Republic Act 6054, also known as the Barangay High School Charter, shortly after the declaration of Martial Law in 1972.

Initially managed by Talipan Elementary School Principal Mr. Reynaldo Ladlad, with Mr. Tolentino as the first teacher, the school started with 60 students. As the school grew, more educators joined, including Mr. Rodrigo G. Porta, who taught multiple subjects, and short-term teachers Mr. Carlito L. Obien and Mrs. Carmelita A. Mangubat. The school held its first graduation in 1976. As enrollment increased, leadership transitioned to several notable figures, including Mrs. Virginia M. Magbuhos, who became the school‚Äôs official principal in 1992.

Talipan National High School expanded its facilities through funding from international agencies such as ESF and JICA, along with support from local government units and key figures like the late Governor Raffy P. Nantes, who donated computer units and helped build a covered court. Later, Governor Jayjay Suarez also contributed to school infrastructure by donating another computer building. The school has continuously developed under various principals, with significant progress in campus beautification and modernization achieved under the leadership of Mr. Gregorio I. Racelis, who spearheaded the school‚Äôs involvement in DepEd‚Äôs Brigada Eskwela initiative. Under Principal Caridad C. Grimaldo‚Äôs term, the school earned the prestigious Brigada Eskwela Hall of Fame Award in 2017.

Today, Talipan National High School is headed by Principal Luningning R. Mendoza, DEM, and supported by seven department heads and over 200 teaching and non-teaching staff. The school continues to excel not only in academic performance but also in extracurricular achievements, producing students who succeed in journalism, sports, arts, and science. With its commitment to holistic, values-based education, TNHS remains a cornerstone of quality public education in Southern Luzon.</p>

Over the years, it expanded through various administrations, gaining classrooms, facilities, and specialty buildings such as the Shop, Domestic Science, and Administration buildings. In 1975, the school was split into three‚ÄîPagbilao Central, East, and West Elementary Schools‚Äîbefore being merged again in 2005.

                    <h4><strong>More about <br> Quezon National Agricultural School  </strong> </h4>
<br> <Br><strong>Quezon National Agricultural School (QNAS) </strong>, founded in 1960, began as a vocational high school for boys focused on agriculture and has since evolved into one of the leading technical-vocational institutions in Quezon Province. Initially located in the Forest Nursery along Zigzag Road in Pagbilao, the school relocated to its current 31-hectare site through expropriation in the 1970s. Over the decades, QNAS expanded its offerings from basic agriculture to include TESDA-accredited programs in hospitality, food processing, electronics, health care, and other in-demand skills. Its growth was bolstered by national and international partnerships‚Äîparticularly with AUSAID and Germany‚Äôs GTZ-EDET‚Äîwhich enabled infrastructure development, staff training, and modern laboratory construction. The school became one of only 12 Provincial Technical Institutes of Agriculture (PTIA) in the country and has received several prestigious recognitions, including APACC‚Äôs Gold Award and TESDA‚Äôs STAR Ratings for various programs.
Beyond academics, QNAS serves a broader community role by offering its facilities for events like weddings, birthdays, and photo shoots. Notably, it has developed a campus that features a mini-resort, modern food laboratories, guest houses, and even a scenic ‚ÄúI ‚ù§Ô∏è QNAS‚Äù spot popular among students and visitors. QNAS alumni have gone on to build careers both locally and internationally, many working in agriculture, hospitality, and other technical fields. The school‚Äôs reputation as a center for both skills training and life events makes it a unique and cherished institution in Pagbilao.</p>
